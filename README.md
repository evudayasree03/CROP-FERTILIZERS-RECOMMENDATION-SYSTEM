# CROP-FERTILIZERS-RECOMMENDATION-SYSTEM

The Crop and Fertilizer Recommendation System using machine learning will provide personalized recommendations for crop selection and fertilizer usage based on various soil and environmental factors.Precision agriculture is in trend nowadays. It helps the farmers to get informed decision about the farming strategy. The system takes inputs such as soil nutrient ratios N(nitrogen), P(phosphorus), K(Potassium), temperature, humidity, pH levels, and rainfall to predict the best crops to grow and suggest the most suitable fertilizers to optimize soil health. By utilizing data-driven models, the system aims to improve agricultural productivity, enhance sustainability, and promote optimal resource usage.
